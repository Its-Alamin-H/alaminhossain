### About & History of this project ü§ì
---------------------------------------------------
Once upon a time, there was a dedicated individual who embarked on a journey into the world of web development. As they began their learning process, they discovered a vast ocean of inspirational portfolios that showcased the incredible possibilities of modern web design. Among these, they stumbled upon a portfolio website that captivated their attention with its sleek and contemporary aesthetics.
<br>
<br>
However, a wave of demoralization washed over them as they realized that this impressive project was constructed with technologies that seemed light years beyond their current skill set, such as; Framer-Motion-Animations, Gatsby.js, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
<br>
Undeterred by this initial setback, our aspiring developer made a pivotal decision: instead of succumbing to discouragement, they viewed this encounter as a catalyst for growth. With unwavering determination, they embarked on a journey of self-improvement. They devoted countless hours to study and practice, devouring every piece of knowledge they could find.
<br>
<br>
As time flowed onward, six months passed ‚Äîa period of intense dedication and perseverance. Our aspiring developer emerged from this transformative experience with newfound confidence and proficiency. They had successfully acquired the skills necessary to build that once seemingly unattainable portfolio project from scratch. Not only that, but they also went above and beyond by incorporating their own innovative ideas and enhancements, elevating the project to new heights.
<br>
<br>
This individual's triumph was not merely measured by their ability to replicate the initial inspirational portfolio; it was a testament to their tenacity, adaptability, and unyielding passion for self-improvement. Their accomplishment exemplified the spirit of continuous learning and growth that is highly sought after in the world of web development.
<br>
Hopefully when an employer encounters this inspiring story, they are met with an impressive narrative of an individual who faced a daunting challenge head-on, turned it into an opportunity for growth, and emerged victorious. This individual's journey showcases their ability to embrace complexity, overcome obstacles, and strive for excellence. 
<br><br>
Their story serves as a testament to their resilience, adaptability, and commitment to personal and professional development‚Äîa remarkable tale that speaks volumes about their potential as a valuable asset to any team or organization.
<br>

### Previouse Versions and Fixes üë¥
---------------------------------------------------

<!-- VERSION 2.1 -->
<details>
<summary>
<h3> Version 2.1 </h3>
</summary>
A list of all the issues I have fixed and features I have added.

<!-- NAVBAR SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> NavBar Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create interactive logo and fixing the broken link
<pre><code>
Initially I wanted this to be an interactive logo that would have some kind of a hover effect.
However, I decided against it and rather put in a simple tailwind animation.
Eventually I want this to reload the page.
</code></pre>
<li> Clean up the mobile version of the navbar - centering and styling
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling fixes 
I also decided to include links to my different social media pages. 
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- HOME/BANNER SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Banner Page section </h6></summary>
<li> Increase the size and responsivness of the heading text's 
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling fixes.
As well as some media queries.
</code></pre>
<li> Update button link & styling
<pre><code>
SolutionüéØ
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> About Section </h6></summary>
<li> Complete overhaul of the layout of this section - ersponsivness issues
<pre><code>
Initially I was using flex box to handle this, 
however this was causing responsivness issues in the image section.
I decided to implement a grid style for this section on larger screens
then add a media querey to turn it back into flex style for mobile devices 
and to float the image in the text portion for mobile device viewing.
</code></pre>
<li> Update the styling of favourite technologies heading
<pre><code>
This was a small fix, as there was simple implementation of some styling updates
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- EXPERIENCES SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Experiences section </h6></summary>
<li> Creating a mobile view section section - with a hidden horizontal screen 
<pre><code>
This was decevingly less easy to implement as I would have to create a parent div for the sidebar.
This was necessary to handle the overflow-x
Additionally I wanted to hide the scroll bar and had to implement @layers in the global.css
</code></pre>
<li> Decrease the gap between 'About' & 'Experiences' section
<pre><code>
Relativley simple however had to balance this between media queries and screen sizes and padding.
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- PROJECTS SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Projects Section </h6></summary>
<li> Make titel fo projects clickable and with a hover effect. (mobile and desktop view)
<pre><code>
Solution üéØ
</code></pre>
<li> Fix responsivness of noteworthy projects forsmall mobile devices
<pre><code>
I solved this by turning this from a gird layout to a flex-box layout and then having min and max widths.
</code></pre>
<li> Fix animation loading bug 
<pre><code>
My previouse fix was causing some issues of when having the more noteworthy projects open
would cause issues when scrolling to the bottom and scrolling back up.
I had to implement an auto-closing of more projects when scrolling past the projects section into contact.
</code></pre>
<li> Import small photos for moible view
<pre><code>
This was a challenge as I wanted to implement the pictures of the project as a background image.
So what I ended up doing was;
- I edited/photo-shopped the images to work as a background images.
- Implementing a tailwind style for the different background images.
- Then using mediaqueries I could swap between the two different styles.
Eventually I want to clean this code up and keep it DRY
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- Contact & Footer Section -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Contact & Footer Section </h6></summary>
<li> Fix footer bug not showing up in medium screen sizes
<pre><code>
This was simple fix of amending how the media queries were being implemented.
</code></pre>
<li> Adding credit to Brittany Chiangs website on all resolutions
<pre><code>
I added links to Brittany's website in the footer
I also made it so this section will alwasy be shown no matter the screen size
</code></pre>
<li> Increase size of headings and responsivness of text
<pre><code>
This was simple styling and media-queries implementation
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- VERSION 2.0 -->
<details>
<summary>
<h3> Version 2.0 </h3>
</summary>

<!-- NAVBAR SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> NavBar Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create a Logo for my portfolio and include it in the Navbar Section
<pre><code>
Created my logo with online logo maker
</code></pre>
<li> Create a mobile view for the Navbar section with media queries 
<pre><code>
This was a little challenging at first as I had to rework my initial simple navbar.
I needed it to be able to incorporate all the other links that would be lost in the smaller mobile screen 
- such as my email and images with links to github, twitter, linkedin etc.
Further I wanted the mobile view to have animated-loading with framer-motion 
</code></pre>
<li> Adding a button with a link to a pdf of my CV 
<pre><code>
Simple enough to incorporate as just had to include my pdf in the assets folder, 
then wrap it with an anchor tag to link open it to open in a new tab. 
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- HOME/BANNER SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Banner Page section </h6></summary>
<li> Include a auto typing heading effect with job titles 
<pre><code>
I have used this in a previouse portfolio, 
a portfolio I actually built with python and the flask framework.  
So I found an npm package that had the same capabilities and followed the documentation to implement it.  
Simple enough   
</code></pre>
<li> Include a delayed loading effect 
<pre><code>
Again I have used framer-motion in some past projects.
However because of all the different moving parts in this project, 
I had to find a way to make it simpler to understand and use. 
I did this by rather applying this to sections and divs instead of individual elements.
</code></pre>
<li> Update the links and sizing of the headings with media queries 
<pre><code>
Very simply just used media queries within tailwind.
</code></pre>
</details> 

<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> About Section </h6></summary>
<li> Create Skills-Icons with some hover effects
<pre><code>
Simply added some images to my assets folder
Imported them to the component 
Applied some tailwind styling with simple animation
Applied media queries to handle responsivness
</code></pre>
<li> Update the profile image and try replicate the design and animations of Britanny Chiang
<pre><code>
This was challenging to replicating the animation
I solved the first problem by wrapping the children div in a container div
using groups, group-styling and absolute styling, as well as z indexes
</code></pre>
<li> Making the image dynamic 
<pre><code>
The second problem I decided to keep it more simple for mobile devices
by simplifying the image and then floating it inside the text section.
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- EXPERIENCES SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Experiences section </h6></summary>
<li> Replicate the same style as Brittany Chang
<pre><code>
When I initially tried to do this, it was getting a little convoluded.
I initially tried to keep this in one component, however soon realised this would not work.
So I had to create pages then create a sidebar that could link to the different pages 
</code></pre>
<li> Trying to implement a way to keep this code dry and easier to update
<pre><code>
I did this by seperating my work experiences into a seperate folder 
I could then call on the different files depending on the onClick 
</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- PROJECTS SECTION -->
<details>
<summary><h6> Projects Section </h6></summary>
<li> Fixing a bug with medium screen sizes causing componenets to dissapear
<pre><code>
This was a simple fix with an error in how I was using and implementing the media-queries
</code></pre>
<li> Create a special Mobile view for capston projects
<pre><code>
This was a challenge as I wanted to implement the pictures of the project as a background image.
So what I ended up doing was;
- I edited/photo-shopped the images to work as a background images.
- Implementing a tailwind style for the different background images.
- Then using mediaqueries I could swap between the two different styles.
Eventually I want to clean this code up and keep it DRY
</code></pre>
<li> Fixing a bug for styling issues in the 'other noteworthy projects'
<pre><code>
This bug was created because of the framer-motion implementation.
There was an issue of how the different cards were being called in.
</code></pre>
